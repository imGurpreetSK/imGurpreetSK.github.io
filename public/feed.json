      "content_text": " Type: Live post Last updated: 13 July, 2025 Software engineering is evolving 1, quite rapidly while at it. While I do fear for my job and what impacts AI might have on me, I cannot say that some part of this AI wave haven\u0026rsquo;t been fun. LLMs and Agents have become a crucial part of my workflow and I\u0026rsquo;ve found myself relying on them much more than I imagined I would. I use Claude/Claude Code as my daily driver, with Gemini as fallback for one-off chat scenarios or for rare cases requiring it\u0026rsquo;s generous context window.\nThis post acts as one where I put my thoughts on things, how I use different tools and what works for me. Expect this to be updated with time, as I learn more.\nChanges I see Prototyping is becoming much cheaper \u0026ldquo;A prototype is an early sample, model, or release of a product built to test a concept or process.\u0026rdquo; Wikipedia\nIt\u0026rsquo;s becoming much quicker - and easier - to get to a working prototype. Verifying a hypothesis is becoming cheaper as Vibe coding gains popularity. For me, vibing practically implements the principle of \u0026ldquo;Iterate quickly, produce results\u0026rdquo; and as long as I do not see a Vibe-PR™ raised to prod, I\u0026rsquo;m all in favor of it.\nAccelerated learning Whether it\u0026rsquo;s about working on projects that I\u0026rsquo;ve wanted to implement or learning about projects I\u0026rsquo;ve wanted to explore, learning new things has become easier than it ever has been.\nWant synopsis of a project? Here it is. A detailed document on workings of the core rendering engine? Can do. Want to create a game using tech you\u0026rsquo;ve never used? Sure thing.\nDescribe what you need Claude Code to do and it\u0026rsquo;ll iterate on it with you until you\u0026rsquo;re satisfied with the results.\nWhat I\u0026rsquo;ve learnt so far AI has a multiplicative effect Agents and LLMs demonstrate a multiplicative effect on an individual\u0026rsquo;s abilities - High ability individuals see their impact increase multifold. With the changes we\u0026rsquo;re seeing, Engineers who\nThink from first principles Have strong fundamentals Communicate effectively Collaborate efficiently, and Have good intuition seem to excel at AI adoption and reap most benefits.\nContext is King The information provided to the LLM during conversation is called the Context. The initial prompt, conversation that follows and any additional setup information picked from memory and other files, external links, etc all form the Context for the LLM.\nProviding the correct amount of context is critical; provide less details and you won\u0026rsquo;t get the desired outcome, share too much and you risk wasting effort due to large context-related problems. It\u0026rsquo;s important to say that providing the correct amount of context is quite difficult - iterating on the initial prompt, steering the conversation in the correct direction, even restarting the chat are expected and helped me learn from mistakes.\nI like to think of my conversation with an LLM/Agent as one similar to one I might have with an intern on my team - they might understand the intent but they can\u0026rsquo;t do exactly what I need without me telling them. It\u0026rsquo;s on me to be explicit and empower them to do a task as expected.\nAs an example, the following is the prompt I first used to start my recent pong-wars project. The prompt doesn\u0026rsquo;t define the task very well and the result was way off of what was expected.\nHow can I create something like https://github.com/vnglst/pong-wars using compose multiplatform? The current project has been created for you as a starter project targeting Android, iOS, desktop and web using compose multiplatform for UI code sharing. Conversely, the following prompt performed much better and generated a project that could be further iterated on:\nProblem statement: I want to create a game using kotlin multiplatform as shown in the video here: [link](https://private-user-images.githubusercontent.com/3457693/300288131-4eae12fa-bdc1-49ee-8b39-c94deb7cb2c8.mov?jwt=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.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.xdwdcwuE-Cmi0sxjhbkHhtSA9Lm8WmtJypyFYqYkiDo) The target platforms are Android, iOS, web and desktop. The UI is to be created using Compose multiplatform. The game starts with the square area split vertically into two equal parts with two balls, one on each side. Overview: Area description: The area is composed of smaller squares, all of equal size. The squares on the same side are of the same color. As soon as a ball hits a square, it bounces back to the opposite side. The square is marked claimed by the ball and its color changes to the opposite color. Additionally, the counter increases by one showing the squares count claimed by each color. Each square has a 1px black border. Ball description: Each ball is of the same color as the opposite area. As soon as the ball hits a square, it bounces back to the opposite side. The square is marked claimed by the ball and its color changes to the opposite color. Additionally, the counter increases by one showing the squares count claimed by each color. The ball moves at a constant speed throughout the area. If the ball hits a wall, it bounces back to the opposite side. Game termination: The game keeps on going indefinitely until closed by the user. Task: 1. Break the task into smaller tasks. 2. Provide a list of tasks to complete. Take approval on execution plan before making any changes. 3. Once each task is complete, commit the changes with a meaningful commit message. 4. Start with the next task only once the commit has been approved by me. I\u0026rsquo;m loving planning mode Imagine conversing with a highly-knowledgeable coworker who understands the problem space, is non-judgmental, is commendably patient and is always available to chat. That\u0026rsquo;s how I feel about planning mode.\nI can have long discussions to refine an idea into deliverable milestones and actionable tasks, all while steering the conversation towards my desired outcome. If I feel like, I can later ask the peer to be an expert programmer and pair with me to implement a part or whole of the feature we just discussed at length.\nDo not blindly trust all actions I\u0026rsquo;ve had tests deleted from codebase to achieve \u0026lsquo;Ensure all tests pass before committing changes\u0026rsquo;. LLMs can play dirty to achieve task completion; I\u0026rsquo;d suggest actively reviewing the changes they make and uphold them to same standards as a developer.\nWhile I understand the lure of --dangerously-skip-permissions (or similar) but I\u0026rsquo;d recommend keeping it only for side projects running in an isolated container.\nHow LLMs and Agents improve my productivity The following is a list of workflows where I see highest positive impact of using LLMs and Agents:\nExperiments and spikes\nThis is the one area that has been impacted the most, in a way that looking back at older ways of operation feel dirty. I have saved hours while joyfully experimenting as I focus on the what to do than how to do it. To top that, if things don\u0026rsquo;t work out as planned, I can just /clear and git reset and start again - the fear of failure has turned into joy of learning by exploration and I\u0026rsquo;m thankful for that.\nJira tickets\nIf you haven\u0026rsquo;t tried connecting to Atlassian services via MCP server, I\u0026rsquo;d highly recommend you do. My recent Jira workflow has essentially stripped down to asking Claude Code to Come up with a plan to implement Jira ticket PROJ-1234 after I break down the task into smaller, well defined sub-tasks that can be run and committed by agents.\nI also sometimes use Jules by Google for asynchronous work, mainly for project chores.\nProject exploration\n/init, if not done already Tweak as required for best experience Help me understand the application architecture or What does the CoreRepository do? or Go through the git history and help me understand how X component evolved over time or any other project related answers, delivered hot right to your screen. Side projects\nI want to work on side projects that help me learn something new. This is much more lucrative now - the speed of execution has increased due to the decrease in cost of bootstrapping. By this I mean I can now focus on learning about the one thing that matters to me the most without having to go through the pain of setting up the project first.\nThis simply let\u0026rsquo;s me learn new things more efficiently.\nLearning\nTwo tools I use frequently to learn about concepts or systems that I do not work directly with are\nDeepWiki\nMostly to explore libraries used in projects - explore them to have a high level understanding of how they work and itch my \u0026lsquo;buy how\u0026rsquo;.\nNotebookLM\nFor researching topics and asking questions interactively. I love NotebookLM because I provide the sources, with option to explore similar sources recommended by the book. Currently, I\u0026rsquo;m creating a notebook to learn more about Gradle and project structuring.\nYet to explore Multi-agent workflows Anthropic\u0026rsquo;s Write tests, commit; code, iterate, commit (TDD) workflow E2E tests with Maestro/Android Studio journeys/playwright Footnotes Links I\u0026rsquo;d highly recommend watching Andrej Karpathy\u0026rsquo;s talk Software is changing (again). Simon Willison\u0026rsquo;s amazing blog. David Crawshaw: How I program with Agents Armin Ronacher\u0026rsquo;s talk on Agentic Coding Claude code best practices In particular: Simon on future of programming Notes Regardless of the use case Ask for options, a lot. First iteration is rarely what you want. Always ask for a plan first, and be explicit with this - think, harder, ultra, think step-by-step are your friends. ",

      "title": "Kotlinx Serialization - How the serialization process works",
      "summary": "",
      "content_text": "\nNow that we know the basic concepts of kotlin serialization and have also seen how to use it to serialize and deserialize data, let’s talk a bit about the library’s internal working and some of the important concepts.\nNote: If you haven’t gone through the previous posts, you should take a look at those first.\nThe entire process of serialization is composed of two separate sub-processes:\nSerialization Encoding Each of these processes has a single responsibility, which enables clear separation of roles and allows both to operate independently. This is the reason behind the extensibility and flexibility of the library. Please note that despite being independent, these operations are still sequential— encoding always takes place after serialization.\nSerialization process Deserialization process Serialization is the process of decomposing the input entity into a stream of primitive elements — characters, ints, booleans and so on — so that they can be ‘encoded’ by the encoder. This process can be recursive, meaning that any complex entities inside the input will be further broken into primitive elements. The process is considered completed once all of the input is converted to a stream of primitive elements, and there are no more complex entities remaining.\nEncoding is the part where the input is actually processed. The stream of primitives generated by the serialization process are fed to the encoder as an input. The encoder’s action can be conversion to another desired format, storing, processing or transforming the data into some other format, or something else based on one’s requirements.\nWe’ll know more about Encoding in a later post, for now let’s focus our energies on the first part of the process — Serialization.\nRemember the User object which we used to understand the basics in the introductory blog post? We’re going to use that to look into the workings of plugin and runtime.\n@Serializable data class User(val name: String) Whenever we call User.serialize(), we obtain an object of type KSerializer. Let’s look into the generated code to know how things are structured and get a high level understanding of what’s going on inside, because Hey! code never lies :)\nI’d highly suggest you to open up your IDE, paste the above code in a scratch file (if you don’t have it already) and decompile it to Java code by going to Tools \u0026gt; Kotlin \u0026gt; Show Kotlin Bytecode and then clicking on Decompile.\nIf you’ve ever inspected or played around with generated code for data classes before, you’d notice some similar code along with quite a lot of extra code. This code is generated by the @Serializable annotation, and mainly includes\nA synthetic, deprecated and inaccessible constructor A nested static class $serializer, also deprecated and inaccessible The role of the constructor is to initialise the properties of the data class. Now, as this constructor is hidden, it must be used internally in the same class. If we look closely, the constructor is used during deserialization of data to create the class object, in our case a User object.\nThe $serializer class is what contains all the logic for the serialization process. This generated class implements an interface called GeneratedSerializer, which in-turn implements the KSerializer interface and overrides a number of methods. KSerializer governs the serialization and deserialization process for an object by defining strategies for serialization and deserialization — SerializationStrategy \u0026amp; DeserializationStrategy. These are responsible for defining how the actual serialization and deserialization of an object work. The interface also defines an object of type SerialDescriptor, which contains metadata related to the object and describes internal structure of data to be transformed.\nIf we look back at the generated class $serializer, we see a SerialDescriptor object, along with two methods which use this object:\nserialize() — This method is defined in SerializationStrategy interface and its implementation describes the actual serialization process. It receives the value to be encoded and dispatches one or multiple commands to the Encoder to transform the value. deserialize() — This method is defined in DeserializationStrategy interface and its implementation describes the actual deserialization process. It receives the value to be decoded and dispatches one or multiple commands to the Decoder to transform the value. The major implementation difference is that unlike serialize(), this method needs to handle values coming in an arbitrary order so that values are bound to the desired properties. Both the Encoder/Decoder expose only structural methods to the external world, while encapsulating the internal implementation of the format the data is being serialized to.\nHope this was helpful and you learnt something new. If you haven’t gone through the previous posts, you should take a look at those.\nHope it helps!\nOriginally posted on Medium link\n",

The interface also defines an object of type \n\n\n\u003ca href=\"https://github.com/Kotlin/KEEP/blob/serialization/proposals/extensions/serialization.md#descriptor-of-a-serializable-entity\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003eSerialDescriptor\u003c/a\u003e, which contains metadata related to the object and describes internal structure of data to be transformed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf we look back at the generated class $serializer, we see a SerialDescriptor object, along with two methods which use this object:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eserialize() — This method is defined in SerializationStrategy interface and its implementation describes the actual serialization process.

      "summary": "",
      "content_text": "\nIn the previous posts we learned about the basics of kotlin serialization. We instantiated a Json object, passing it a configuration and used it to perform serialization and deserialization operations. This post is about that configuration, called JsonConfiguration — why is it required and what role does it play in the process.\nThe JsonConfiguration class is provided by the serialization runtime library and allows us to customise JSON behaviour as per our requirements. It is a simple data class with various properties and two out-of-the-box configurations:\nStable — adheres to the JSON specification restrictions (RFC-4627) and is guaranteed to preserve its semantics between library releases. Default — This configuration is what the library recommends for JSON format. It is not guaranteed to preserve its semantics and might change as the runtime library evolves until it hits a version 1.0.0. Being a data class, you can also copy either of these configurations and make changes as per your requirements, or create a configuration from scratch if that suits your use-case better.\nCustomisable properties\nFollowing are the various available options for JSON-specific behaviour customisation (along with certain examples):\n1. encodeDefaults Denotes whether the serialized JSON contains properties with default values or not.\n2. ignoreUnknownKeys If false, any unknown properties in JSON will cause the deserialization to fail. This flag is true by default in stable configuration, however it’s a wise choice to keep it false to maintain backward compatibility while interacting with frequently changing objects or external APIs.\n3. isLenient If set to true, removes JSON specification restrictions and allows parsing of malformed JSON objects. In following example, notice how the input JSON is unquoted, yet the parsing succeeds. However, the parsing will still fail if any string values has spaces or delimiters.\n4. serializeSpecialFloatingPointValues As the name suggests, allows serialization of special floating point values in the JSON. These values are Infinity, -Infinity and NaN. As a note, you should give a thought why these values are required to be parse at first place.\n5. unquotedPrint If true, the output JSON does not have quoted strings. This option is not recommended to be used except for rare debugging purposes as the parsed JSON is invalid. If any of the values in deserialized output has a string with spaces or delimiters, it will always be quoted.\n6. prettyPrint If set to true, the output JSON will be pretty-printed.\n7. indents Specifies the indent to use while parsing and pretty-printing JSON. Pretty printing has to be enabled while providing a custom indent, else the serialization will fail with an IllegalArgumentException. The next few properties we’ll talk about allow transformation of JSON from one form to another to support certain features which might be legacy or unsupported by default.\n8. allowStructuredMapKeys In JSON, only primitives can be used as keys. The serialization will fail with the following error if we have some non-primitive type representing a key in the object to be parsed.\nValue of type \u0026#39;kotlin.collections.LinkedHashMap\u0026#39; can\u0026#39;t be used in JSON as a key in the map. It should have either primitive or enum kind, but its kind is \u0026#39;MAP.\u0026#39; If you need to serialize a JSON with say a map as a key, you can enable allowStructuredMapKeys flag. This will transform the serialized JSON from a map of key-value pair to a flat list of keys and values.\n9. useArrayPolymorphism This flag works only if you’re performing polymorphic serialization ( this article and the class docs do a really good job of explaining what polymorphic serialization is). This flag causes the serialized JSON to be produced in the legacy array format instead of the object format.\nIf array polymorphism is not used, the following JSON is obtained:\n[{\u0026#34;type\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;Dog\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;lovesTreats\u0026#34;:true},{\u0026#34;type\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;Cat\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;lovesSleeping\u0026#34;:true}] The ‘type’ in above JSON is called the class discriminator, and can be customised too!\n10. classDiscriminator Use this property to give a custom name to the JSON property describing the class. In the above example, if we pass classDiscriminator=”class” to the JsonConfiguration, the following JSON would be obtained\n[{\u0026#34;class\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;Dog\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;lovesTreats\u0026#34;:true},{\u0026#34;class\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;Cat\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;lovesSleeping\u0026#34;:true}] Hope this was helpful and you learnt something new.

      "summary": "",
      "content_text": "\nKotlin serialization is kotlin-first, compile-time, type-safe, reflection-free and completely multi-platform ready serialization mechanism to convert kotlin objects into data formats like JSON or Protobuf and vice-versa. It is comprised of a compiler plugin which is used to generate code for serializable classes and a runtime library, containing core classes and primitives for serialization \u0026amp; IO, among some other things.\nKotlinx serialization runtime project structure While JSON format is supported out of the box by the library, there’s first-class support for other formats like Protobuf \u0026amp; CBOR, with the option to extend the functionality by writing your own library to support any other format.\nThe effort was first announced in October 2016, where @elizarov posted about the team’s efforts on “working on a generic Kotlin Serialization facility for some future release of Kotlin”. You can know more about the design, goals and core concepts of kotlin serialization by going through this KEEP.\nWhy? Code sharing between platforms isn’t easy. Each platform you want to support has different ways of handling different things — IO, transformations, threading, serialization to name a few. There already are various libraries out there which support kotlin serialization, even generate kotlin code if you want to, Square’s Moshi being probably being the most famous one.\nHowever, all of these work only on JVM and don’t support other platforms. That’s why a new mechanism is required — one that supports all the platforms.\nSetup Please refer to the official guide to setup. It’s simple, all you’ll need to do is :\nApply the serialization plugin, and\nAdd dependency on the runtime library in your build.gradle file.\nYou’ll need to be on Kotlin version 1.3.70 or higher to use runtime library version 0.20.0, which is the latest release at time of writing this article.\nLearning by examples (You can see all these examples as a series of unit tests here in this gist.)\nLet’s go through some of the basic cases you’re likely to encounter if you plan on using kotlin serialization in one of your projects.\n1. Parse JSON object to Kotlin object Suppose you want to convert a JSON object to a kotlin object. For this, you’ll need to specify two things:\nThe object to which you’re trying to parse the JSON to, and The behaviour of the JSON format you’re trying to parse Let’s say we want to parse JSON containing user’s information — just his name for now. The JSON looks like {“name”: “Gurpreet”}.\nIn Kotlin, this can be represented as a data class User with a name property.\ndata class User(val name: String) However, this class can’t be used just yet for serialization purposes as we haven’t told the compiler to generate serialization code. This is where @Serializable annotation comes to use. This annotation instructs the compiler to generate code required for performing serialization for our class.\n@Serializable data class User(val name: String) That it! It’s as simple as that. Now the compiler can understand and serialize User objects.\nNext, we need to define JSON format behaviour we’re trying to pass. We do this by specifying a Json instance. From the docs, this class is\nThe main entry point to work with JSON serialization. It is typically used by constructing an application-specific instance, with configured json-specific behaviour. We’ll also need to defined what type of JSON we’re expecting. We define this using JsonConfiguration. This class helps us configure the behaviour for Json object. We’ll discuss more about this class a later, but for now, it’s good to know that it provides two ready to use configurations for us to use — Stable and Default. We’ll use the Stable configuration, which adheres to the JSON specification restriction and is provided by the runtime library.\nNow that we’ve gathered information about what we need, we can take a look at code to serialize the JSON to an object. It’s as simple as calling parse on the Json instance we have created. You have to pass the serializer and the JSON you want to parse.\nJson(JsonConfiguration.Stable) .parse(User.serializer(), \u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34;{\u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Gurpreet\u0026#34;}\u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34;)// Output: // User(\u0026#34;Gurpreet\u0026#34;) The above code reads “Parse this input JSON to a User object using the serializer provided. The JSON provided to the parse is ‘stable’ i.e., adheres to the standards”.\n2. Convert Kotlin object to JSON To deserialize an object (i.e. to convert it to JSON), stringify method can be used. Unlike parse, this method takes the kotlin object to deserialize as an argument.\nThe following code snippet shows how we can convert User object to JSON.\nJson(JsonConfiguration.Stable) .stringify(User.serializer(), User(\u0026#34;Gurpreet\u0026#34;))// Output: // {\u0026#34;name\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;Gurpreet\u0026#34;} 3. Parsing an object containing a list of objects Let’s say you have to parse a list of contacts instead of a single object and the JSON looks something like\nval jsonToParse = \u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34;{ \u0026#34;result\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Contact 1\u0026#34; }, { \u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Contact 2\u0026#34; }, { \u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Contact 3\u0026#34; } ] }\u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34; Looking at the structure, we can infer that we need an object which contains a list of User objects. We define it as follows:\n@Serializable data class User(val name: String)@Serializable data class Contacts(val result: List\u0026lt;User\u0026gt;) Notice that we’ve marked both the classes as @Serializable. If we don’t mark User as @Serializable, the compiler will report an error which says Serializer has not been found for type \u0026lsquo;User’, essentially meaning that it doesn’t know how to serialize the type.\nIt’s pretty straight-forward from here. We need to serialize the JSON to Contactsobject, similar to how we parsed a User object before\nJson(JsonConfiguration.Stable) .parse(Contacts.serializer(), jsonToParse) // Output: // Contacts(listOf( // User(\u0026#34;Contact 1\u0026#34;), // User(\u0026#34;Contact 2\u0026#34;), // User(\u0026#34;Contact 3\u0026#34;) // )) Note that you can obtain the JSON back by using stringify in this case too.\n4. Parsing a list of objects If you noticed, all the types we have talked about till now are user defined types. We learnt about how to serialize and deserialize them. But what about the cases where we want to operate on a collection of objects, for example, a list of Users? We can’t apply @Serializable on a class we don’t own 🤷‍♂.\nFor this, the team at Jetbrains has got us covered 🎊. Serializers to parse widely used collections — Lists, Maps and Sets — are provided by the runtime library out of the box . To parse a list of contacts as shown below, we can use ListSerializer. All we need to do is tell what type of objects the list comprises of, which is User in our case.\nval listOfContacts = \u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34;[ { \u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Contact 1\u0026#34; }, { \u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Contact 2\u0026#34; }, { \u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Contact 3\u0026#34; } ]\u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34; To serialize the JSON, we do\nJson(JsonConfiguration.Stable) .parse( ListSerializer(User.serializer()), listOfContacts ) // Output: // listOf( // User(\u0026#34;Contact 1\u0026#34;), // User(\u0026#34;Contact 2\u0026#34;), // User(\u0026#34;Contact 3\u0026#34;) // ) Similarly, we can deserialize the list to JSON by\nJson(JsonConfiguration.Stable) .stringify( ListSerializer(User.serializer()), listOf( User(\u0026#34;Contact 1\u0026#34;), User(\u0026#34;Contact 2\u0026#34;), User(\u0026#34;Contact 3\u0026#34;) ) ) // Output: // [{\u0026#34;name\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Contact 1\u0026#34;},{\u0026#34;name\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;Contact 2\u0026#34;},{\u0026#34;name\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;Contact 3\u0026#34;}] You can also serialize Maps by using MapSerializerand Sets by using SetSerializer in a similar way.\nHope this was helpful and you learnt something new. You can read the continuation article to this which talks about handling optional and transient properties.\nThis article is first of a series of articles I’m writing on Kotlin serialization while also learning more about the same. Stay tuned, stay inside and keep reading!\nHope it helps!\nOriginally posted on Medium link\n",

      "title": "Kotlin Sequences",
      "summary": "",
      "content_text": "Transforming, filtering, manipulating and operating on data is what every developer does almost every day at their jobs. If you’re using Kotlin for writing your applications, you might have used map or filter operator to transform a collection from one form to another.\nAlong with the kotlin.collections package, Kotlin also provides a way to lazily represent and evaluate a collection of data. This is accomplished using Sequences.\nSequences are a collection of possibly infinite data, ordered in a certain way. Sequences are a part of the language standard library and allow lazy evaluation of large amount of data (in millions), as opposed to collections, which compute and evaluate operations on a data set eagerly.\nLooking at the source, it’s pretty clear that the Sequence interface is similar to Iterable in definition:\npublic interface Sequence\u0026lt;out T\u0026gt; { operator fun iterator(): Iterator\u0026lt;T\u0026gt; } public interface Iterable\u0026lt;out T\u0026gt; { operator fun iterator(): Iterator\u0026lt;T\u0026gt; } Sequences maintain the same API as collections. The difference comes in the way they are implemented. Let’s take an example to understand.\nLet’s suppose we have a list of customers, and each customer has a recorded unique id, first name, last name and age.\nprivate const val UNDEFINED = -1 data class Customer( val firstName: String, val lastName: String? = null, val age: Int = UNDEFINED ) Next, let’s define some data to demonstrate:\nprivate fun getCustomers(): List\u0026lt;Customer\u0026gt; { return listOf( Customer(\u0026#34;Ragunath\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Jawahar\u0026#34;, 31), Customer(\u0026#34;Dinesh\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Raja\u0026#34;, 28), Customer(\u0026#34;Donn\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Felker\u0026#34;, 42), Customer(\u0026#34;RMK\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;\u0026#34;), Customer(\u0026#34;Omar\u0026#34;) ) } Now that we’re done with the basic setup, let’s define the problem statement. Let’s say we need to get the first names of all the customers whose age is not UNDEFINED and whose last name isn’t null. We can do this using the filter and map operators provided by the Collections API:\nfun main(args: Array\u0026lt;String\u0026gt;) { val result = getCustomers() .filter { it.lastName != null } .filter { it.age != UNDEFINED } .find { it.age == 31 } println(result) } Here, we first filter the customers whose last name is null, then filter customers whose age is UNDEFINED. Finally, we map the remaining customers’ first name and collect them in a list. If you run the above example, the output would be as expected:\nCustomer(firstName=Ragunath, lastName=Jawahar, age=31) But what were the operations leading to this output? If we put an onEach operator after each operation and print the value input to the function, the output would be something on the lines of:\nfilter lastName: Customer(firstName=Ragunath, lastName=Jawahar, age=31) filter lastName: Customer(firstName=Dinesh, lastName=Raja, age=28) filter lastName: Customer(firstName=Donn, lastName=Felker, age=42) filter lastName: Customer(firstName=RMK, lastName=, age=0)filter age: Customer(firstName=Ragunath, lastName=Jawahar, age=31) filter age: Customer(firstName=Dinesh, lastName=Raja, age=28) filter age: Customer(firstName=Donn, lastName=Felker, age=42)Customer(firstName=Ragunath, lastName=Jawahar, age=31) The result above shows Eager evaluation. The filter operation is applied on the entire collection (input), and an intermediate collection is formed. This intermediate collection is then passed down the chain to the next filter, which repeats the process and passes another collection to the find function, which returns the result.\nThis approach has two drawbacks:\nCreation of varying number of intermediate collections, depending on the number of operations to be performed, and Processing of all elements in the collection, even if it is not required. This hardly makes any difference in this tiny example, or even for any relatively larger use case for that matter (thanks to judicious use of inlined functions in stdlib and good garbage collection support by JVM),\nBut think about a case where the input data is in order of Millions, or virtually infinite? Wouldn’t it be nice if we could compute on data one after another, and bail as soon as the required condition is met?\nThis is exactly what sequences do! Here’s what the code above would look like when using sequences:\nfun main(args: Array\u0026lt;String\u0026gt;) { val result = getCustomers() .asSequence() // Creating a sequence .filter { it.lastName != null } .filter { it.age != UNDEFINED } .find { it.age == 31 } // Terminal operation println(result) } We create a sequence by wrapping the existing collection, and returning its elements when being iterated. If we apply the onEach function here and check the output, it’ll look like\nfilter lastName: Customer(firstName=Ragunath, lastName=Jawahar, age=31)filter age: Customer(firstName=Ragunath, lastName=Jawahar, age=31)Customer(firstName=Ragunath, lastName=Jawahar, age=31) Once a terminal operation is encountered, computations are carried out one after another, and as soon as a result is found, execution is stopped. This is why sequences are called lazy.\nA visual comparison of how collections and sequences work can be:\nYou might have noticed the term ‘Terminal’ operation. If we remove it, no computation will be carried out. This is because operations on a sequence are divided into two categories: Intermediate and Terminal.\nIntermediate operations return a sequence which knows how to transform elements of the original sequence. These operations are always lazy, and are postponed until a terminal operation is performed. The terminal operation performs all the postponed operations and returns a some value as a result.\ngetCustomers() .asSequence() // Creating a sequence .filter { it.lastName != null } // Intermediate operation .filter { it.age != UNDEFINED } // Intermediate operation .find { it.age == 31 } // Terminal operation “Okay, this looks interesting. Let’s use sequences EVERYWHERE!”.\nNope. Please don’t.\nAs a rule of thumb, a sequence should be used at places where a chain of operations are being performed on a very large (or possibly infinite) collection of data, and/or there is a need to break out of the computation as soon as an element matching the predicate is found. As mentioned earlier, eager operations on regular collections are highly optimised and efficient in kotlin and should fare you well for most cases.\nAnother thing to remember is that the elements of a sequence cannot be accessed as simply as elements of a collection. For example, the following snippet will produce a compile-time error:\nfun main() { val sequence = (1..10) .asSequence() .map { it * 3 } println(sequence[1]) // Error: Unresolved Reference. None of the following candidate is applicable because of receiver type mismatch. } This is because the accessed element might not have been processed at all! (remember lazy evaluation for sequences?)\nHope this helps!\nOriginally posted on Medium link\n",
