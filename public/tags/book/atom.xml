      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently read Radical Candor by Kim Scott and it seems it&amp;rsquo;s one of the books that I would definitely revisit to re-learn from. It is an engaging read and is very informational whether you are a manager, an individual contributor, or just someone trying to learn and work better in an organizational setting. Though I picked the book to improve my personal communication skills with my team and my managers, I do believe that reading the book has made me a better communicator overall, especially when trying to convey intent and handling situations with a higher degree of emotional intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
