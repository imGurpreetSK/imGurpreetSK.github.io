      <description>&lt;p&gt;This year, I finally had the chance to attend KotlinConf in Copenhagenâ€”a conference Iâ€™ve wanted to experience for a long time. It was also my first time visiting Copenhagen and exploring Europe, which made the trip even more memorable. The week was powered by plenty of falafels, chocolate, and coffee. (On the flip side, I had the worst pizza of my lifeâ€”definitely not what I expected from Europe!)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;exciting-announcements&#34;&gt;Exciting Announcements&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;KotlinConf 2025 was packed with exciting updates for the Kotlin community. Iâ€™m especially looking forward to new language features like rich errors, name-based destructuring, and context receivers. The introduction of Junie and &#xA;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/JetBrains/koog/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Koog&lt;/a&gt; also caught my attentionâ€”they both look promising for future projects. Another big highlight: CMP for iOS is now stable! ðŸŽ‰&lt;/p&gt;</description>
