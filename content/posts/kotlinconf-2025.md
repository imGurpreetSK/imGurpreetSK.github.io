This year, I finally had the chance to attend KotlinConf in Copenhagenâ€”a conference Iâ€™ve wanted to experience for a long time. It was also my first time visiting Copenhagen and exploring Europe, which made the trip even more memorable. The week was powered by plenty of falafels, chocolate, and coffee. (On the flip side, I had the worst pizza of my lifeâ€”definitely not what I expected from Europe!)

## Exciting Announcements

KotlinConf 2025 was packed with exciting updates for the Kotlin community. Iâ€™m especially looking forward to new language features like rich errors, name-based destructuring, and context receivers. The introduction of Junie and [Koog](https://github.com/JetBrains/koog/) also caught my attentionâ€”they both look promising for future projects. Another big highlight: CMP for iOS is now stable! ðŸŽ‰

## My KotlinConf Experience

### Day 0: Registration

The first day was all about getting settled in, picking up my badge, and soaking in the excitement of being surrounded by fellow Kotlin enthusiasts.

### Day 1: Meeting the Community

Day one was a whirlwind of meeting amazing Android and Kotlin engineers. It was refreshing to have real conversations in person, rather than just chatting online. Some highlights:
- **Meeting Urs Peter:** Urs has a way of explaining things that makes even complex topics easy to understand. I could listen to him talk for hours.
- **Danâ€™s Talk:** Danâ€™s session was insightful and definitely one of the must-see talks of the conference.
- **Chris Hornerâ€™s Session:** Chris gave a fantastic talk on building fully custom UIs with Compose. It was both practical and inspiring.
- **Catching Up with Seb:** Always a pleasure to meet Seb and exchange ideas.

### Day 2: More Great Talks

On the second day, Ralfâ€™s talk stood out for me. His insights and presentation style made it one of the highlights of the conference.

## Final Thoughts

There were a few people I didnâ€™t get a chance to say hi to, which I regretâ€”but thereâ€™s always next time. For now, Iâ€™m off to find some more falafel and reflect on an inspiring week.

Till next time!
