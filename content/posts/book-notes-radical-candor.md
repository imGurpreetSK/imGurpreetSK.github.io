I recently read Radical Candor by Kim Scott and it seems it's one of the books that I would definitely revisit to re-learn from. It is an engaging read and is very informational whether you are a manager, an individual contributor, or just someone trying to learn and work better in an organizational setting. Though I picked the book to improve my personal communication skills with my team and my managers, I do believe that reading the book has made me a better communicator overall, especially when trying to convey intent and handling situations with a higher degree of emotional intelligence.

The book is divided into two parts:

1. The first part talks about the 'What', followed by
2. The second part dealing with 'How', providing more practical and hands-on knowledge.

For me, the first part is an elaboration on the most important statement of the book - definition of the term "Boss" and why despite having some stigma attached it's better than the terms 'Manager' and 'Lead'. Kim defines a boss as someone who **guides a team to achieve results**. After establishing this in the first chapter, Kim masterfully elaborates each key term in next 3 chapters: guide, team, and results.

Another thing is the dimensions of Radical Candor and what it is not. If you cannot care personally and challenge deeply, it's not Radical Candor.
