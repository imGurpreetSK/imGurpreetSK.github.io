One of the apps that I've been using so much as of late is called [Wispr Flow](https://wisprflow.ai/). It is a smart dictation app that solves a real problem — at-least for me — and probably has a usage workflow of any app that I've used.

I have a lot of random thoughts and post ideas during my day but I've never been able to jot them down because I've always felt I'm not articulate enough to write a 'perfect' post.  Wispr Flow allows me to speak my thoughts into any of the text boxes I choose to focus on transcribes thoughts into words - it's a literal thoughts-to-words process for me, and I'm enjoying it. I would love to have it on my Android phone as well, but seems like the company does not give enough of shits for Android users. Though, given I use a laptop for most of the work that I do, it's not as big of a problem yet.

One thing I do look forward to experimenting with is a product called [Whispering](https://epicenter.so/whispering) which potentially does the same thing and is open source and free.
