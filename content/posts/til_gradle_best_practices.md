I can't believe I've worked with Gradle for so many years and yet I stumbled upon [Gradle best practices](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/best_practices_general.html) just now. I wish I had gotten hold of this sooner, though I'm sure I'll be referencing this quite often.

Leaving this here for someone (future me) to find this.
