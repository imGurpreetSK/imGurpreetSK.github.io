One of my best purchases has been a subscription to [Darbar player](https://darbar.org/player/). Despite being a long-time listener and appreciator of the festival, I inexplicably denied myself this joy for years.

If I could revisit past decisions, subscribing to Darbar would be near the top of my list.

Watching masters collaborate with humility is profound. They acknowledge the vastness of what they don't know while possessing oceans of knowledge. Their lifelong dedication to understanding the unknown through their craft is both humbling and inspiring. I aspire to channel even a fraction of their commitment into perfecting my own work.

Two performances currently captivate me, though countless others deserve equal mention:

1. [Pandit Uday Bhawalkar | Full Concert | Khayal](https://player.darbar.org/videos/061a-df2011-uday-bhawalkar-directors-cut)
2. [Sukhvinder Singh | Director's Cut | Tabla](https://player.darbar.org/videos/dch640-df2021-sukhwinder-singh-directors-cut) 
3. Any performance by [Pandit Yogesh Samsi](https://www.yogeshsamsi.com/)
