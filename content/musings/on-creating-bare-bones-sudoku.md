I love John Crickett's coding challenges. They're (almost) bite sized challenges that can be done in a weekend and extended as much as you want to add more functionalities. I highly recommend you try some.

I've been trying to do them during my weekends but work has been catching up recently. It was a [fun task to create Sudoku](https://codingchallenges.fyi/challenges/challenge-sudoku) this weekend; I hope you do too if/when you try it. I implemented [my solution](https://github.com/imGurpreetSK/codingchallenges/tree/main/sudoku) as a desktop app using Kotlin Multiplatform to share business logic and Compose Multiplatform to share UI logic across clients. I'd try creating mobile/web clients using this in the future to explore KMP further.
