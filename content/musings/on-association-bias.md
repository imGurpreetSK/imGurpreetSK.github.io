A quote by Mark Twain from the book "The art of thinking clearly" by Rolf Dobelli:

> We should be careful to get out of an experience only the wisdom that is in it - and stop there; les we be like the cat that sits down on a hot stove-lid. She will never sit down on a hot stove-lid again - and that is well; but also she will never sit down on a cold one anymore.

Association bias is real - don't let false connections degrade the quality of your decisions. Correlation does not always imply causation.
