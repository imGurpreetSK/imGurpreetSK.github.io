Notes from video [How to improve negotiation skills](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLBRRNwMZNE):

1. Positions vs Interests
    - Focus on interests instead of positions. Ask “Why?”. Why does a person want something so strongly.
    - Show care by be understanding the other person.
    - Be open, talk openly. This applies to both sides.

2. Use fair standards
    - Unbiased rules which don’t include personal outlooks.
    - Avoids conflict and arguments.

3. Invent options for mutual gain
    - All involved parties might not need the exact outcome.
        - Definition of success might be different for all.
        - Differences aren’t always a bad thing; might lead to creative outcomes where all parties are content.
    - Separate brainstorming from selection.

4. Separate the people from the problem
    - Person first - negotiators are people-first.
    - Be soft on the person, hard on the problem.
        - Don’t harm the relationship.
            - Pay attention to what you want.
            - Do not hurt egos - yours or others’.
        - Complement and appreciate effort.
    - Informal interactions beforehand help.

5. Not everything goes well - other side might not play by fair rules

6. Use of dirty/pressure tactics
    - Call out directly, remembering the above 4 skills

7. Other side has big guns (more power over you than other way around Eg. interviewing with no job offers vs 2 job offers)
    - Recognize B.A.T.N.A - Best Alternative To a Negotiated Agreement
    - The difference is power

8. Personal attacks
    - Use Negotiation Jujitsu - side step their attacks, ask “Why?”.
    - Ask for their advice.
    - Invite criticism instead of defending their ideas.

9. Lastly, asking “Who’s winning” in a negotiation is like asking it in a marriage. If you find yourself with it, you’ve missed the point.
