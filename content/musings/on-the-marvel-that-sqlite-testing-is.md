"Small. Fast. Reliable. Choose any three." - https://www.sqlite.org/testing.html

I highly recommend reading the entire document. It outlines the various cases SQLite is tested for which makes it as reliable as it is to be able to make the above claim. It also boasts the thoroughness of tests, having roughly 590 lines of test code for a single line of library code.
