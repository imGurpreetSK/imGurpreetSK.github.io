While listening to an [interview](https://player.darbar.org/videos/shivkumar-sharma-in-conversation) by Pandit Shivkumar Sharma ji, something quite interesting caught my attention.[]
He talks about the importance of a Tabla player actively listening to the music happening on the stage while doing Sangat. "If you can't listen to the music and enjoy and respond to it, you are just playing a taal; not doing sangat - and that's essentially taalmala[1](#footnotes)".

I feel the same thing goes for Software engineers and AI replacing them - AI perhaps is going to elevate the level of operation from writing code to forcing people to think more about their impact on a team/organizational level. As LLMs/Agents have a multiplier effect, people failing to adapt to having an eventual net-positive impact will probably be negatively impacted due to this shift in Software Engineering.
