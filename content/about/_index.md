## Hi! I'm [Gurpreet Singh](https://www.linkedin.com/in/imGurpreetSK/)

I work on mobile applications to positively impact users' lives and deliver delightful mobile experiences.

I'm a Principal Software Engineer currently working with [JobGet](https://www.jobget.com/), leading the Android team.
Prior to JobGet, I worked as a Principal Product Engineer at [Gojek](https://www.gojek.io/), leading the Driver Earnings & Experience team.

My responsibilities include regularly shipping high-quality software, enhancing developer experience and collaborating with other teams to solve problems while improving the organisation's mobile engineering culture.
I am an advocate of test-driven development, hermatic test automation and CI/CD and truly believe functional-style code with explicit side-effect handling results in higher quality, more maintainable and understandable products.
During my weekends, I enjoy experimenting with and learning new technologies. I also enjoy meeting people through meetups and developer conferences, where I sometimes talk and share my thoughts.

### How I got started

I have always had a keen interest in computers, beginning with playing games on my uncle's Windows 98 machine back in early 2000s.
Recognizing my passion, my parents got me my first PC, which allowed me to play with HTML, Visual Basic and C++ during my school years.
In college, I pursued software development by working on my startup and gaining experience in full-stack development for a couple of years.
I started working with Android in 2016, consulting for a few startups before joining [Kite](https://kite.work/) as a Software Engineer.
