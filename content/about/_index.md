## Hi! I'm [Gurpreet Singh](https://www.linkedin.com/in/imGurpreetSK/) ðŸ‘‹

##### [Resume](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rls1JHFn3G8Jc8sjdeCdAx-cdCDEI6Qe/view?usp=sharing/) [Email](mailto:gurpreetsk@hotmail.com) [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/imGurpreetSK/) [Github](https://github.com/imGurpreetSK/)

I craft mobile applications designed to positively impact users' lives and provide delightful experiences. As a Principal Software Engineer at [JobGet](https://www.jobget.com), I work with the Mobile team on a platform connecting over 100 million US job seekers to opportunities.

My focus is delivering tangible product impact through technical excellence. This means shipping high-quality software via initiatives like:

1. Architecting and leading implementation of core system: Increased average RPU by 110% and user base by 20%.
2. Developing key retention features: Cut monthly acquisition costs from $80k to $27k.
3. Spearheading stability improvements: Reduced crash and ANR rates by over 90% (to <0.04%) and significantly boosted store ratings.

My approach combines enhancing developer experience and strong cross-team collaboration with advocating for practices like TDD, hermetic automation, CI/CD and functional programming â€“ because these directly contribute to building better, more maintainable products. Streamlining workflows is also key; for example, I previously championed changes that reduced CI/CD costs by 30%.

Prior to JobGet, I was a Principal Software Engineer at [Gojek](https://www.gojek.com), leading the Driver Earnings & Experience team where our focus on measurable outcomes led to a 7% average increase in partner earnings.

### How I got started

I have always had a keen interest in computers, beginning with playing games on my uncle's Windows 98 machine back in early 2000s.
Recognizing my passion, my parents got me my first PC, which allowed me to play with HTML, Visual Basic and C++ during my school years.

In college, I pursued software development by working on my startup and gaining experience in full-stack development for a couple of years.
I started working with Android in 2016, consulting for a few startups before joining [Kite](https://kite.work/) as a Software Engineer.
